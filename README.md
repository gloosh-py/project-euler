# project-euler
This is my attempt to solve Project Euler problems with Python at https://projecteuler.net/archives.

I'll attempt to solve the first 100 problems just for some fun and practice to strenghten my Python knowledge after a Python Fundamentals course at Algebra, Zagreb.

Only first 100 problems because projecteuler.net will block any account that publicly posts solutions for any problems after the first 100.
